It is also possible to define how to read in other cells not defined in Ferrite using the same technique, but that also requires defining further information to be able to use such cells in Ferrite later.\n\n(Image: )\n\nusing Ferrite, FerriteMeshParser\n\nThe Wedge cell has the same node order in Ferrite as in Abaqus (above). Hence, in this case it is not required, but if desired it can be changed by overloading the function FerriteMeshParser.create_cell as follows\n\ncreate_cell(::Type{Wedge}, node_numbers, ::FerriteMeshParser.AbaqusMeshFormat) = Wedge(ntuple(j->node_numbers[j], length(node_numbers)))\n\nThis setup allows changing the node order for your specific element.
